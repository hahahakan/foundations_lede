Moore. Mr. Kroger.  \n",
       "1  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The court of appeals held that Arizona v. Fulminante was the clearly established Federal law to control and govern the outcome of this case. This was an error, because this Court has never applied Fulminante's direct appeal harmless error standard, which places the burden of proof on the government, to a collateral ineffective assistance of counsel claim, where the burden of proof is on the inmate. In Boyer, unlike Fulminante, there is no trial transcript to review because the defendant pleaded no contest or guilty before trial. The court of appeals' decision conflicts with both Strickland v. Washington and Hill v. Lockhart and will have grave negative consequences for our criminal justice system. \n",

However, it certainly does not imply, as the court of appeals proceeded to do here, that it controls the prejudice prong of Strickland, that it sets a new standard of review of harmlessness, that it shifts the burden of proof onto the government, or that it limits the prejudice analysis to that question of the potential impact of the confession at trial. And so for all those reasons, I -- I think the -- the court of appeals has gone well beyond any potential relevance of the Fulminante decision.  \n",

I'm assuming you are not taking your amicus's position that we have to get to the question of what would have \n",
       " happened in a motion to suppress -- but that under all circumstances, if there's a suppressible confession, a defendant should never plead guilty. You are saying that that conclusion is what the Ninth Circuit drew and that was wrong?  "

Brandeis said that the right to be let alone is the most important, and so he must have been thinking there could be a tort there for interference with privacy, and the First Amendment doesn't stop State tort laws in appropriate circumstances.  \n",

And I'm taking that we are speaking now of the intrusion claim, and I believe that I could offer you a compare and contrast two extremes that may help us here. On the one hand, you have a body of law that comes under the heading of captive audience. And you can go into that body of law and read all those cases in one sitting, so to speak, from which you would conclude that it is very narrow, it is very limited, and there must be some actual physical sound, sight, intrusion, if you're talking about invasion of privacy. At the other extreme, for a compare and contrast, is what they seek in this case, what the trial judge gave them in this case, which is: In an unspecified period of time that each individual will call their mourning period, no one, at any time, any place, any manner, may say any word that that mourner says caused me emotional distress.  \n",

The Government has required them for all civil service employees since 1953 and for contractors since 2005. If the Ninth Circuit in this case held that a constitutional right to informational privacy precluded asking the questions it asked, that was wrong for two basic reasons. First, the background checks' mere collection of information with accompanying safeguards vitiates no constitutional privacy interest. These checks have been going on for millions of employees for dozens of years. They are part of the employment process. They are manifestly not roving checks on random individuals. And, second  \n",

For -- for one -- for one thing, things like a name or even a fingerprint, this Court has said is not a separate Fourth Amendment event to acquire that.

All the requirements I just described that are under the Privacy Act would not have existed at common law invasion of privacy even though common law invasion of privacy was, as you say, compensable with emotional distress awards.

Instead, that version of the Act in section 5(c)(2)(B)(iii) assigned to the Privacy Protection Study Commission the task of making a recommendation as to whether the Act should later be expanded to provide for general damages.

So the person who's arrested sitting at his desk at the office, in reaching area from his computer would be open to a full search under the government's rule. There was also discussion about the exigencies at the scene of an arrest, needing to prevent a remote wipe, preventing a password from kicking in. The first thing to make sure you understand is those arguments can apply only at the scene. They don't apply in this case, where an officer takes the phone back to the police station and 2 hours later searches through it as his  at his leisure. So all the arguments about at the scene and what the officer needs to be able to do at the scene can be left for another case. And I think Justice Breyer is exactly right.

       "      <td>Mr. Chief Justice, it's an arms race between the forensic capabilities of law enforcement labs and the abilities of cell phone manufacturers and criminals to devise technologies that will thwart them. And they will leapfrog each other at times and there may be periods when law enforcement has the advantage and there may be period where  periods where those people who want to protect against revelation of data on the phone will succeed. And my only point here is that it would not be a wise rule for this Court to announce, based on today's technology and reasonable projections of technology, that the police will just easily be able to go and get a warrant, because my experience from the people that I had spoken with is that a lot of phones are arriving at the lab in a locked and encrypted state and it's very tough to deal with that. And if the Court does have concerns, as many members of the Court have expressed, about applying, lock stock and barrel, the traditional Robinson rule, there are weigh stations and compromise positions.

But the Federal Circuit held that Section 289 of the Patent Act entitles the holder of a single design patent on a portion of the appearance of the phone to total profit on the entire phone. That result makes no sense. A single design patent on the portion of the appearance of a phone should not entitle the design-patent holder to all the profit on the entire phone. Section 289 does not require that result, and as this case comes to the Court on the briefing, Apple and the government now agree that Section 289 does not require that result.

The district court said, no, I already said no apportionment back in the Daubert. Because I said no apportionment, she shut us out of both theories.

The same is true of the licensee in the General Talking Pictures scenario. He could -- he could convey the right -- he could basically convey authority to use it in the home market, and that's what the patentee was compensated for in that sale, but he could not convey a right he didn't have, which is to use it in the commercial market. So that -- and that right was retained by the patentee. He was not compensated for it. And yet, supposedly, because there was an authorized sale, there's no infringement.

But let me ask you this: Suppose your client were an oldschool guy and he didn't have  he didn't have a cell phone. He had a billfold and he had photos that were important to him in the billfold. He had that at the time of arrest. Do you dispute the proposition that the police could examine the photos in his billfold and use those as evidence against him?  \n",

You can make an argument, and if I needed to, if it were a diary case or a billfold case, you might be able to make an argument, but I think the Court wisely decided under Robinson that we need a categorical rule that's easily administrable in the field.

The difficulty with that case, if you wanted to address it in a future case, would be the intertwined nature of information on a phone. So looking at those photos in a smartphone account will be linked to the contacts inside the phone; it will be linked to GPS information inside the phone. All of this information is intertwined and I think you'd have a difficult administrability problem if you wanted to create some sort of rule like that. Now, remember, the government might try to deal with that problem differently by saying information in the cloud, so to speak, is not accessible to officers. We submit that just further would compound the difficulty of applying a rule in this circumstance.  \n",

The reason I think that you don't find diary cases when you look for them is because people hardly ever carry a diary outside the home with them. It was kept in a private drawer in the bedroom or wherever it might be kept, and in the highly, highly unusual circumstance where somebody did, you might have a hard case. This is an  this is the opposite world. The modern reality of smartphones is that it is an indispensable item for everyday life of a modern professional and, indeed, most anyone. You can't leave the house without it and be  consider yourself to be responsible and safe.

We're talking about smartphones, which are minicomputers. But your theory would apply to iPads, computers, anything that's, for example, sitting next to a person in a car, at their desk if they are arrested at their desk, anywhere if they are carrying it in their hand because you see a lot of people carrying the iPad or something comparable, a tablet of some sort. Your theory would permit a search of all of those things.  \n",

To the extent it wouldn't, you'd have a really difficult struggle on a casebycase basis to answer the very difficult question whether any particular app had fundamentally different information that existed in the nondigital world.

Remember, Chimel gives authority to search and seize without a warrant anything in the grab area if there's a destruction argument. So the person who's arrested sitting at his desk at the office, in reaching area from his computer would be open to a full search under the government's rule. There was also discussion about the exigencies at the scene of an arrest, needing to prevent a remote wipe, preventing a password from kicking in. The first thing to make sure you understand is those arguments can apply only at the scene. They don't apply in this case, where an officer takes the phone back to the police station and 2 hours later searches through it as his  at his leisure. So all the arguments about at the scene and what the officer needs to be able to do at the scene can be left for another case. And I think Justice Breyer is exactly right. At the very best what the government has shown is that there may be certain tightly limited circumstances where exigent circumstances would apply.

But in all of the other cases that you could imagine that involve searches for evidence, letters, which occur in the historical cases; billfolds, which have been discussed here, once the officer has it, you could say the officer shouldn't be able to look in it because that could be done under a warrant.

We discussed earlier the threat of remote wiping and whether airplane mode is an effective counter to that.

Because if the phone turns off and becomes encrypted, officers can go to the magistrate and ask for a warrant, but it may be months or years or never if they can break through the encryption and actually obtain the evidence. So to the extent that the traditional destructionofevidence rationale justified the search of a cell phone or justified the search of traditional items, it applies even more strongly with respect to cell phones than it does with most of the items that might be seized from a person.

And my only point here is that it would not be a wise rule for this Court to announce, based on today's technology and reasonable projections of technology, that the police will just easily be able to go and get a warrant, because my experience from the people that I had spoken with is that a lot of phones are arriving at the lab in a locked and encrypted state and it's very tough to deal with that. And if the Court does have concerns, as many members of the Court have expressed, about applying, lock stock and barrel, the traditional Robinson rule, there are weigh stations and compromise positions.

But the question is -- and now -- and -- and this goes back now to Mitchell, Mitchell said nobody can convey more than they have. That's why in Mitchell the licensee could not convey the right to continue to use the patented machine after the expiration of that first period, because it's not a right that he had. The same is true of the licensee in the General Talking Pictures scenario. He could -- he could convey the right -- he could basically convey authority to use it in the home market, and that's what the patentee was compensated for in that sale, but he could not convey a right he didn't have, which is to use it in the commercial market. So that -- and that right was retained by the patentee. He was not compensated for it. And yet, supposedly, because there was an authorized sale, there's no infringement.

They conduct visual surveillance. And under a principle of law that says 1 trip is okay but 30 trips is not, there is absolutely no guidance for law enforcement in how they are  \n",

It authorized entering the car in order to install it, which wasn't necessary here. It also authorized monitoring the car in a location where there was a reasonable expectation of privacy.

And monitoring an individual through their clothing poses an extremely high likelihood that they will enter a place where they have a reasonable expectation of privacy.  \n",
